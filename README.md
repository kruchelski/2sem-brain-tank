# BRAIN TANK  

## Assignment for Web Development I course.   
---
### Justification  
The Web Development 1 course has a final assignment that must be done in group. The ideia of this exercise is to practice the languages and stuff learned through an application that make use of a login system, css, javascript, php, sql database and basic security measures to avoid xss and sql injection attacks.  
This application was made in colaboration with [Andre K. Antunes](https://github.com/andrekantunes). In general, the frontend was mostly made by Andre and the backend by me.  
    
### Description  
Brain tank is an application in which the user can write words or short sentences and after they will start to float in the screen, like bubbles in a water tank. The goal is to present the user's ideas and thoughs in a different way so the visualization can make possible to form up new ideas, like a brainstorming.  
At any moment the user can click over a bubble and it will disappear.
The application uses a login system which provides the possibility of each user maintain it bubble's group  

### Instructions  
- Preparation - check out the  'db_credentials.php' file. Change it according to your settings for access the database
- Running for the first time - First of all it's necessary to create the database and the tables used in the application. The easiest way is to first open the 'db_create.php' page which will create a database, and then (if not redirect automatically) open the 'db_create-table.php' page, which will create the two tables used in this application. After that (if not redirect automatically), open the 'pagez.php' to, in fact, run the application.
- Running after the first time - Simple open the 'pagez.php'

### Specs 
During the development and the presentation of the Braint Tank, the environment used was:
- Apache  
- MySQL  
- PHP  

### Why not use a index.php?
Randomness (noobie stupidity)

### Final considerations  
As this web application was made as an exercise, this means that is possible that have bugs and, also,  the application is not the best possible.  
**Important**: The reason I created this repository is to share with other class colleagues or anyone who needs examples of web development.  
PS: Any suggestion for improvment is welcome
